	abstract = {Coupled-mode equations describing the propagation and scattering of internal waves over large-amplitude arbitrary topography in a two-dimensional stratified fluid are derived. They consist of a simple set of ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of modal amplitudes, based on an orthogonality condition that allows one to distinguish leftward- and rightward-propagating modes. The coupling terms expressing exchange of energy between modes are given in an analytical form using perturbation theory. This allows the derivation of a weak-topography approximate solution, generalizing previous linear solutions for a barotropic forcing that were described in 2002 by Llewellyn Smith and Young . In addition, the orthogonality condition derived is valid for a different set of eigenmodes defined on a sloping bottom, which shows a better convergence rate when compared with the standard set of modes. The work presented here provides a useful and simple framework for the investigation of internal wave propagation in an inhomogeneous ocean, along with theoretical insight.},

	abstract = {Instabilities of hurricane-like vortices are studied with the help of a rotating shallow-water model, including the effects of moist convection. Linear stability analysis demonstrates that dominant unstable modes are mixed Rossby–inertia–gravity waves. It is shown that, depending on ﬁne details of the vorticity proﬁle, a wavenumber selection of the instability may operate or not, leading in some cases to an unstable mode with a distinctively maximal growth rate and in other cases to an ensemble of unstable modes with close growth rates. Numerical simulations are performed in order to investigate nonlinear saturation of the instability and to understand the dynamical role of moisture. In agreement with previous studies, the authors conﬁrm axisymmetrization of vorticity in the course of the development of the instability, which induces changes of intensity of the hurricane. In ‘‘dry’’ simulations, winds are intensiﬁed only inside the radius of maximum wind, while the maximum value of the wind decreases. ‘‘Moist precipitating’’ simulations (with and without evaporation) exhibit a net increase of winds, also at the radius of maximum wind, as compared to the dry simulations. Dynamical effects of moisture on the reorganization of the vortex and on the efﬁciency of inertia–gravity wave emission are quantiﬁed and shown to be considerable. Periodic bursts in the emission of waves related to the development of the unstable modes inside the vortex are evidenced, as well as the appearance of convectively coupled waves in the moist precipitating simulations with evaporation.},

We ﬁnd that different types of instabilities with low azimuthal wavenumbers exist, and may compete. In a wide range of parameters, an asymmetric version of the standard centrifugal instability has larger growth rate than the latter. The dependence of the instabilities on the parameters of the ﬂow, i.e. Rossby and Burger numbers, vertical shear and the ratios of the layers’ thicknesses and densities, is investigated. The zones of dominance of each instability are determined in the parameter space. Nonlinear saturation of these instabilities is then studied with the help of a high-resolution ﬁnite-volume numerical scheme, by using the unstable modes identiﬁed from the linear stability analysis as initial conditions. Differences in nonlinear development of the competing centrifugal and ageostrophic barotropic instabilities are evidenced. A nonlinear mechanism of axial symmetry breaking during the saturation of the centrifugal instability is displayed.},

	abstract = {The factors influencing the structure of hydrothermal communities are not necessarily similar across geographical regions and vent fields. In the present study, we explore the role of environmental conditions on vent community structure at local and regional spatial scales, focusing on the assemblages dominated by the engineer species Bathymodiolus azoricus. Their presence in several vent fields on the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) represents a unique opportunity to compare their associated fauna and to better understand large-scale biodiversity patterns. Two types of factors were considered: exogenous ones such as the presence of biogeographical barriers, depth, and distance between sites, and those linked to the intrinsic characteristics of each field (endogenous factors, e.g. local abiotic conditions). The main goals of our study are to describe and compare the biological and environmental characteristics of mussel assemblages collected from three vent fields – Menez Gwen (MG), Lucky Strike (LS) and Rainbow (RB) – located in the Azores Triple Junction on the MAR. These fields differ in the chemistry of their end-member fluids, their depths as well as their geological settings. We focus on the composition, abundance, and diversity of the macro- and meiofauna associated with the vent mussels. Comparing them between vent fields and among the different edifices of a single vent field (Lucky Strike) allows us to study the influence of exogenous and endogenous factors at local and regional scales. On the local scale, our results show that the pool of species associated with B. azoricus is largely shared between the edifices of LS, which suggest no obstacles to species dispersion across the field. However, differences in relative abundances foster mussel assemblages with varying diversity, probably linked to differences in local abiotic conditions between the various chemistry domains of the field. At larger scale, we observed a “vent field signature” in the communities associated with B. azoricus. Distinct patterns of abundances and diversity were observed across the three fields, with MG appearing as a particular case. The presence of a longitudinal current to the south of this field and its depth difference may partially explain those discrepancies. This study represents one of the most comprehensive integrated faunal and environmental datasets obtained across hydrothermal vent fields.},

These waves match well with the linear theory describing topographically-generated internal waves, which can be used to estimate the associated vertical transport of momentum and energy extracted from the mean flow. Finally, small scale topographic features are shown to have a significant impact on the mean flow in this region of the Gulf Stream, and the specific role of lee waves in this context is outlined.},

This paper describes the circulation in the rift valley along the Azores sector of the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge, using a combination of {\textbackslash}textit\{in-situ\} data from several surveys and realistic high-resolution modelling. It confirms the presence of a mean deep current with an up-valley branch intensified along the right inner flank of the valley (looking downstream), and a weaker down-valley branch flowing at shallower depth along the opposite flank. The hydrographic properties of the rift-valley water, and in particular the along-valley density gradient that results from a combination of the topographic isolation, the deep flow and the related mixing, are quantified. We also show that the deep currents exhibit significant variability and can be locally intense, with typical values greater than {\textbackslash}SI\{10\}\{cm/s\}. Finally, insights on the dynamical forcings of the deep currents and their variability are provided using numerical simulations, showing that tidal forcing of the mean circulation is important and that the overlying mesoscale turbulence triggers most of the variability.},

These contribute significantly to energy dissipation, tracer mixing, and exchanges between the ocean surface layer, the ocean interior, and the atmospheric boundary layer. Internal waves and submesoscale motions both undergo strong spatial and seasonal variations, driven by different mechanisms. Here, we investigate the sea surface signature of internal waves and its seasonality using linear wave theory and a high-resolution realistic simulation. In summer, internal waves are greatly amplified near the surface mostly due to a thin mixed layer bounded by a seasonal pycnocline. This surface amplification is well captured by linear theory, provided that the stratification at the base of the mixed layer is accurately represented. In winter, the superinertial motions are not fully explained by linear theory, reflecting impacts of the more energetic submesoscale motions.},

Understanding their dynamics and lifecycle is necessary to better understand their role in the ocean circulation. In this study, we describe and quantify internal tide generation, propagation, and dissipation in a sector of the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge, using high-resolution numerical simulations with realistic bathymetry and stratification. We show that the generation and dissipation of internal tides, as well as the distribution of internal tides among vertical modes, exhibit high spatial variability. We find that topographic scattering leads to a significant transfer of energy toward high vertical modes and thereby enhances internal tide dissipation. On average, and especially on the ridge, this mechanism is dominant over the conversion from the barotropic tide for transferring energy to high (7) vertical modes. The magnitude of the scattering of the first baroclinic internal mode is found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {Wide-swath altimetry, e.g. the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is expected to provide Sea Surface Height (SSH) measurements resolving scales of a few tens of kilometers. Over a large fraction of the globe, the SSH signal at these scales is essentially a superposition of a component due to balanced motions (BMs) and another component due to internal tides (ITs). Several oceanographic applications require the separation of these components and their mapping on regular grids. For that purpose, the paper introduces an alternating minimization algorithm that iteratively implements two data assimilation techniques, each specific to the mapping of one component: a quasi-geostrophic model with Back-and-Forth Nudging for BMs, and a linear shallow-water model with 4-Dimensional Variational (4DVar) assimilation for ITs. The algorithm is tested with Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) where the truth is provided by a primitive-equation ocean model in an idealized configuration simulating a turbulent jet and mode-one ITs. The algorithm reconstructs almost 80\% of the variance of BMs and ITs, the remaining 20\% being mostly due to dynamics that cannot be described by the simple models used. Importantly, in addition to the reconstruction of stationary ITs, the amplitude and phase of nonstationary ITs are reconstructed. Sensitivity experiments show that the quality of reconstruction significantly depends upon the timing of observations. Although idealized, this study represents a step forward towards the disentanglement of BMs and ITs signals from real wide-swath altimetry data.},

	abstract = {The future wide-swath satellite altimeters, such as the upcoming Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, will provide instantaneous 2D measurements of sea level down to the spatial scale of O(10 km) for the first time. However, the validity of the geostrophic assumption for estimating surface currents from these instantaneous maps is not known a priori. In this study, we quantify the accuracy of geostrophy for the estimation of surface currents from a knowledge of instantaneous sea level using the hourly snapshots from a tide- and eddy-resolving global numerical simulation. Geostrophic balance is found to be the leading-order balance in frontal regions characterized by large kinetic energy, such as the western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Everywhere else, geostrophic approximation ceases to be a useful predictor of ocean velocity, which may result in significant high-frequency contamination of geostrophically computed velocities by fast variability (e.g., inertial and higher). As expected, the validity of geostrophy is shown to improve at low frequencies (typically 0.5 cpd). Global estimates of the horizontal momentum budget reveal that the tropical and mid-latitude regions where geostrophic balance fails are dominated by fast variability and turbulent stress divergence terms rather than higher-order geostrophic terms. These findings indicate that the estimation of velocity from geostrophy applied on SWOT instantaneous sea level maps may be challenging away from energetic areas.},
